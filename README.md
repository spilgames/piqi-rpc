Piqi-RPC is an RPC-over-HTTP system for Erlang.


Piqi-RPC gives Erlang developers a convenient and reliable way to connect
services written in Erlang with the rest of the world using JSON, XML or Google
Protocol Buffers over plain HTTP.

Basically, Piqi-RPC can be viewed as an HTTP gateway for Erlang functions. Any
standard HTTP client can communicate with them not knowing anything about
Erlang or Piqi-RPC. And the opposite is also true: Erlang functions work with
idiomatic Erlang data structures and donâ€™t have to be aware of HTTP or even
Piqi-RPC.

In other words, Piqi-RPC system automates several areas where Erlang developers
usually need to write (and maintain!) a lot of boring plumbing code:

**Parsing and validating input parameters** -- Piqi-RPC automatically parses
XML, JSON, Protocol Buffers and command-line arguments, validates them and
converts to idiomatic Erlang data structures.

**Generating output parameters** -- again, Piqi-RPC automatically generates XML,
JSON and Protocol Buffers from native Erlang representation.

**HTTP communication** -- Piqi-RPC provides fully-compliant HTTP communication
layer. It receives and validates HTTP requests, sends responses, handles
"Content-Type" and "Accept" headers and generates around 10 different meaningful
HTTP response types for various error conditions that can occur during request
execution.
