Piqi-RPC 0.7.0 (October 28, 2013)
=================================

The main change of this release is the rewrite of the underlying
"piqic-erlang" code generator in Erlang. As a result:

- Piqi-RPC code was moved from the main Piqi project repository into its own
  repo
- drop dependency on "piqi_src" and OCaml code

This was a major effort and it wouldn't have been possible without support of
many Piqi-erlang and Piqi-RPC users. Thank you everyone for your bug reports,
suggestions and patience.

Thanks to Motiejus Jak≈°tys for contributing the fix for piqic-erlang-rpc not
printing compilation errors.

Other changes:

  - the default Webmachine version is now 1.10.5

Miscellaneous:

  - piqi-rpc documentation is now distributed with the source code
    (doc/piqi-rpc.md)
  - continuous builds via Travis-CI


Piqi 0.6.0 (February 3, 2013)

  project used to be a subtree in the piqi repository):
